# ExperimentalCameraTweaks

I’ve loved the ActionCam feature ever since it was introduced back in Legion, but one thing always annoyed me: every time I logged in, I had to type /console ActionCam full in chat again.

That led me to search for an addon that could automatically enable this setting when I entered the game. Unfortunately, the options I found were either abandoned or overloaded with features, and they often took days to be updated after a new patch.

So I created ExperimentalCameraTweaks! It’s an intentionally simple addon that anyone can quickly update on day one of a new patch.

I’m currently working on figuring out how to disable or auto-accept the visual discomfort alert box that pops up upon login, but I’m not entirely sure if it’s even possible to do.
